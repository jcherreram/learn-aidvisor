# Learn AIdvisor ðŸ§ 

Learn AIdvisor is a Chrome extension that acts as a personal learning assistant. By leveraging the on-device power of Google's Gemini Nano, it analyzes selected text to calculate the reader's required **Attentional Effort (NEA)**, simplifies complex content, and generates personalized comprehension tests and study guides to make online learning more effective and efficient.

## Core Features

* **Attentional Effort Calculation**: Analyzes any selected text to determine its cognitive load, classifying it as LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH effort.
* **Personalized Familiarity Assessment**: Asks targeted yes/no questions to adjust the effort score based on the user's prior knowledge.
* **AI-Powered Text Simplification**: Rewrites complex or dense text into a more digestible format using Gestalt principles of unit formation.
* **Interactive Comprehension Tests**: Generates flashcard-style questions to test understanding of the core concepts.
* **Dynamic Study Guide**: Creates a final, personalized glossary focusing only on the concepts the user found challenging.

## How It Works: The Workflow

1.  **Select Text**: Highlight a piece of text (at least 20 characters) on any webpage.

2.  **Familiarity Assessment**: Answer a few simple yes/no questions about key concepts found in the text.

3.  **Get Your Effort Level**: The extension displays the final Attentional Effort Level.

4.  **Use Learning Tools**: Based on the result, you can simplify the text or generate a comprehension test.

5.  **Take the Test**: Answer the generated questions and rate how difficult it was to recall each answer.

6.  **Generate Study Guide**: After the test, create your personalized study guide.

7.  **Review the Glossary**: The final view provides a focused glossary of the concepts you struggled with, helping you study more effectively.
